clj-tagsoup
===========

This is a HTML parser for Clojure, somewhat akin to Common Lisp's
[cl-html-parse].  It is a wrapper around the [TagSoup] Java SAX
parser, but has a DOM interface.  It is buildable by [Leiningen].

Usage
-----

The two main functions defined by clj-tagsoup are `parse` and `parse-string`.
The first one can take anything accepted by clojure.contrib's [reader] function
except for a `Reader`,
while the second can parse HTML from a string.

The resulting HTML tree is a vector, consisting of:

 1. a keyword representing the tag name,
 2. a map of tag attributes (mapping keywords to strings),
 3. children nodes (strings or vectors of the same format).

This is the same format as used by [hiccup], thus the output of `parse` is
appropriate to pass to hiccup.

There are also utility accessors (`tag`, `attributes`, `children`).

clj-tagsoup will automatically use the correct encoding to parse the file if
one is specified in either the HTTP headers (if the argument to `parse` is an
URL object or a string representing one) or a `<meta http-equiv="...">` tag.
If you are running Clojure from within Leiningen, you might experience
problems with the charsets; see [this blog post] for details.

clj-tagsoup is meant to parse HTML tag soup, but, in practice, nothing
prevents you to use it to parse arbitrary (potentially malformed)
XML. The `:xml` keyword argument causes clj-tagsoup to take into
consideration the XML header when detecting the encoding.

Another option for parsing XML is using the `parse-xml` function. It just
invokes `clojure.xml/parse` with TagSoup, so the output format is
compatible with `clojure.xml` and is not the one described above.

Example
-------

    (use 'pl.danieljanus.tagsoup)
    => nil

    (parse "http://example.com")
    => [:html {}
              [:head {}
                     [:title {} "Example Web Page"]]
              [:body {}
                     [:p {} "You have reached this web page by typing \"example.com\",\n\"example.net\",\n  or \"example.org\" into your web browser."]
                     [:p {} "These domain names are reserved for use in documentation and are not available \n  for registration. See "
                         [:a {:shape "rect", :href "http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2606.txt"} "RFC \n  2606"]
                         ", Section 3."]]]
